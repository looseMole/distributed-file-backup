**Description** \
The purpose of the program is to be able to back up locally stored files - compiled as well as plaintext on the internet
semi-automatically and for free. One of the ways to accomplish this, which will be explored, is encrypting the file
locally, before uploading it to at least two separate websites which offer free APIs for exactly that purpose. The 
download URLs would then be stored on the user's device, and the validity of these links would then be checked 
regularly - if the file where to not be present at one of the sites, the program could simply download it from the
other (if the file cannot be found locally), and try to re-upload it again.
